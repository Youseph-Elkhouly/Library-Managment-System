his project is a Simple Library Management System in C#. It allows users to:

Add books by entering the title, author, and publication year.
Display all books in the library.
Save books to a file, so they are not lost when the program closes.
Load books from a file to see previously saved books.
The project uses classes to organize book details, lists to store multiple books, and file handling to save and load book data. It's a basic system that demonstrates how to manage data and files in C#.

Key Concepts Covered:
Classes and Objects: You create and manage Book objects with properties and methods.
Lists: List<Book> is used to store the collection of book objects dynamically.
File Handling: The program reads from and writes to a file using StreamWriter and StreamReader.
Basic Input/Output: Console input/output is used for user interaction.
